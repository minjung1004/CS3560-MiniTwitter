Required Patterns:
1. Singleton - used for object creation
2. Observer - behavioral, what the object does
3. Visitor - behavioral, what the object does
4. Composite - structures , composition of classes or objects

Singleton Pattern (Interview Pattern)
- class has only one instance
- global point of acces to the instance
- Create instmace admin controll
    - 

Observer
- Between users to:
    - follow
    - tweet

Composite
- Between user and user groups 
    - hierarchy

Visitor
- add functionality to user groups
    - show total number of users
    - show total number of groups
    - show total number of tweets message
    - show perentage of positive tweet


A few analysis features are needed in the admin control panel: 
1) output the total number of users; 
2) output the total number of groups; 
3) output the total number of Tweet messages 
    in all the users’ news feed; 
4) output the percentage of the positive Tweet
    messages in all the users’ news feed 
    (the message containing positive words,
     such as good, great, excellent, etc.)
