Required Patterns:
1. Singleton - used for object creation
2. Observer - behavioral, what the object does
3. Visitor - behavioral, what the object does
4. Composite - structures , composition of classes or objects

Singleton Pattern (Interview Pattern)
- Used to create AdminControlPanel GUI and  User View GUI

Observer Pattern
- used to track and update followers
- used update tweets messages

Composite Pattern
- Used in user and user groups to keep hierarchy in ListView

Visitor Pattern
- add functionality to user groups
- show total number of users
- show total number of groups
- show total number of tweets message
- show perentage of positive tweet


A few analysis features are needed in the admin control panel: 
1) output the total number of users; 
2) output the total number of groups; 
3) output the total number of Tweet messages 
    in all the users’ news feed; 
4) output the percentage of the positive Tweet
    messages in all the users’ news feed 
    (the message containing positive words,
     such as good, great, excellent, etc.)
